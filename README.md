# new-acquisitions-with-primo

## Requirements
Calls to exernal APIs are made using [Httpful](http://phphttpclient.com/) "a simple, chainable PHP library intended to make speaking HTTP painless and interacting with REST APIs a breeze"
  
  
  
## Structure
The main idea:
the Javascript file new_acquisitions.js calls the server via AJAX. The call goes to an interface file, intended for interpreting the request, pass it over to the core classes, receive a response and pass it back to the Javascript file.
